"TP-MAL","out of stock","new","Malabar Blend Pouch","A blend of tastes from the tropical South West of India. Stretching the coast of the Arabian Sea and the foothills of the Western Ghats, port cities of Malabar such as Cochin became diverse and cosmopolitan hubs of ancient maritime commerce. The tea leaves from the southern gardens of Nilgiri produce a dark colour with intense and aromatic flavour. To compliment these earthy notes we have added sweet-scented vanilla, a native crop of the islands lying close to Malabar in the Indian Ocean. Sip a sweet cup of Malabar Blend as you imagine the fresh coastal breeze, palm lined sweeping beaches and exotic history of this nexus of Indian trade and agriculture.

Known for their nagara-style architectural symbolism, the extraordinarily accomplished yet isolated group of temples, were built under the Chandela Empire. Legend has it King Chandravarman was persuaded in his dreams to build a shrine to celebrate the marriage of Shiva to Parvati, symbolically depicting the four goals of life — dharma, kama, artha and moksha. After long years of obscurity, only twenty-five structures, of the original eighty-five, were rediscovered. As the blazing sun retreats and casts shadows on the distinctly carved sandstone of grand architectural imagination, the Khajuraho temples will leave you in awe and wonder.
