93	Kangra	Kangra, the smallest tea growing region in India, is nestled at the foothills of the Himalayas in the northwestern state of Himachal Pradesh. In the mid-19th Century the Chinese variety Camellia senensis (var. senesis) was brought to the region after the lower slopes of Kangra Valley were determined to be ideal for tea cultivation. With the orthodox practices still in use for cultivating tea, Kangra produces a distinctive golden-coloured brew with sweet undertones unlikes teas from other regions.    This season's single-estate:  The Raipur Tea Estate, nestled in the Palampur region of Himachal Pradesh was established in 1894.

94	Darjeeling	Situated at the foot of the Himalayas with views of snow-capped peaks and gently sloping tea gardens, Darjeeling is known as Queen of the Hills. This northernmost district of the Indian state of West Bengal was developed as a tea producing region when seeds of the Chinese variety Camellia sinensis (var. sinensis) were brought from Nepal during the mid-19th Century. It produces a thin-bodied, light-coloured infusion and delicate, floral aroma has earned Darjeeling the title, "champagne of teas".

95	Assam	Assam, a state in the northeast of India, is the largest tea growing area in the world. In the early-19th Century, its indigenous tea bush, Camellia sinensis (var. assamica), was discovered growing wild by the Scottish adventuter Robert Bruce. Most tea is grown in the hilly and mountainous areas of India but, unusually, Assam tea is grown in the lowlands. The nutrient rich clay soil found in the floodplain of the mighty Brahmaputra River gives Assam tea its brisk, malty flavour and vibrant colour.    This season's single-estate:  Established in 1943, Chota Tingrai Tea Estate spans over the Tinsukia district of Assam. Home to 600 families, the estate works towards bringing socio-economic development for their community by training and developing local talent to join their management team.
